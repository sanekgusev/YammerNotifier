YammerNotifier
==============

Ruby scripts to poll for new messages in a [Yammer](http://www.yammer.com) group and send push notifications.

Currently, [Boxcar](http://boxcar.io) is used for notifications.

Requires Ruby 1.9.x.

`yammer_group_poller.rb` does the heavy-lifting, `yammer_cake_notifier.rb` provides a usage example.
